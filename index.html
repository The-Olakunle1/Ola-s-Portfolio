      Hey, I'm Olakunle 👋
    </h1>
    <p class="hero-description">
      Insight-driven Product Designer based in <span class="current-location"> Brighton, England.</span>
      Welcome to my Personal website.

    <p class="hero-body">
      I am obsessed with the way the web works and crafting beautiful and friendly experience for real people.

      I currently am a UX designer at <a class="current-work" href="https://www.mpb.com" target="_blank">MPB</a> - The largest global platform to buy, sell, and trade used photo & video kit.

      I'm a designer who enjoys collaborating with cross-functional teams to create intuitive, scalable solutions. 
    </p>
    <p class="hero-body">
      I combine qualitative, quantitative research and,   behavioural insights to deeply understand user needs and guide design decisions.
    </p>

    <p class="hero-body">
       My work is driven by both user impact and business goals, ensuring the solutions I create are friendly, effective and grounded in real evidence.
    </p>

    <p class="hero-body">
      I have a range of skills that span user research, UX and interaction design, conversion rate optimisation through experimentation, and frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allowing me to collaborate effectively across disciplines and bring ideas to life with precision.

  To stay sharp and learn, I take on interesting, challenging personal projects which allow me to constantly push myself and my boundaries through a range of diverse problems and acquire more skills. Here are some examples of my work:
