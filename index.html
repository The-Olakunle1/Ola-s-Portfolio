      Hey, I'm Olakunle 👋
    </h1>
    <p class="hero-description">
      Product designer @MPB based in <span class="current-location"> Brighton, England.</span>
      Welcome to my Personal website.

    <p class="hero-body">
      I am obsessed with the way the web works and enjoy crafting beautiful and friendly experience for real people.

      I currently am a Product Designer at <a class="current-work" href="https://www.mpb.com" target="_blank">MPB</a> - The largest global platform to buy, sell, and trade used photo & video kit, where I design solutions for millions of users across 10 countries in two continents. 

      I thrive in cross-functional collaboration, creating intuitive, scalable products that deliver real impact.
    </p>
    <p class="hero-body">
      I combine qualitative, quantitative research and,   behavioural insights to deeply understand user needs and guide design decisions.
    </p>

    <p class="hero-body">
       My work is driven by both user impact and business goals, ensuring the solutions I create are friendly, effective and grounded in real evidence.
    </p>

    <p class="hero-body">
      I have a range of skills that span user research, UX and interaction design, conversion rate optimisation through experimentation, and frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allowing me to collaborate effectively across disciplines and bring ideas to life with precision.
   </p>

   <p class="hero-body">
    When I'm not working, you'll find me cycling along the Brighton seafront, camera in hand. 🚴🏾‍♂️🚴🏾‍♂️ 📸

  To stay sharp and learn, I take on interesting, challenging personal projects which allow me to constantly push myself and my boundaries through a range of diverse problems and acquire more skills. Here are some examples of my work:
 </p>
<li class="hero-body">
   I cofounded and lead Product and Design at <a href="https://swap-space.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swap Space</a>. Swap space allows people explore the world more affordably through home swaps and exchanges. 
</li>
<li class="hero-body">
  I built  <a href="https://github.com/The-Olakunle/Speaker-Notes/releases/tag/speakernotesv2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaker Note</a>. A macOS native app that lets you write and organise your speaker notes and present smoothly through a teleprompter window.
</li>
